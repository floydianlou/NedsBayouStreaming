# *NED'S BAYOU - MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE*

**Ned's Bayou** is a simulated music streaming service made with Django for a [University project](https://www.ing-inl.unifi.it/vp-130-terzo-anno.html#).
The website takes inspiration from all the currently famous streaming platforms for styling and main functionalities and tries to replicate the most common features: making, creating and editing an account, liking songs, creating playlists and browsing a catalogue either by seeing personalised recommendations, a full list of songs or by searching a term on the search bar.
On Ned's Bayou you automatically start with a Listener role, which can do all previously listed activities; if you're not logged in, you'll still be able to browse the website and see other people's profiles and playlist creations, but you won't be able to like songs or create your own playlists.
By using the Django Administration Panel, some accounts can also cover a Curator role and access the "Curator Dashboard" to add, edit or delete all songs, artists and genres.

> All songs use the same track as to not violate any copyright laws. I used an instrumental version of [Heavydirtysoul by Twenty One Pilots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXRdS9cynQ) which I found for free on multiple Reddit threads and online.
